# About Me
Hello! My name is Madi, I use pronouns she/her/hers, and I am a student in the Telling Stories with Data class. I was born Georgia, raised in South Carolina, and now live here in Pittsburgh, PA. I am a Master of Arts Management student at Heinz College and also studied at Carnegie Mellon University for my undergraduate degree in Vocal Performance. I have a horse named Basya that I keep in Ohio, and I miss life outside of the city.

# What I Hope to Learn...
I hope to learn a little bit more about coding than I already know, as well as how to creatively look at data and find new ways to present it. I'm a very visual peson, so I look forward to thinking critically and creatively. 

# Portfolio
This is where all of my data visualizations will go!
